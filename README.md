# PsychoJS Experiment Modules

This repo offers some modules for use in online PsychoJS experiments. Currently, we have:
 - JSON-based questionnaire
 - Image-based instructions

Tutorials on how to use each aspect can be found in each file, building on top
of the auto-generated PsychoJS code coming from a PsychoPy project.
